What are the dimensions of a standard passport photo?

Standard passport photo dimensions vary by country, but here are the most common sizes:

United States: 2 √ó 2 inches (51 √ó 51 mm)

Most European countries, Australia, India: 35 √ó 45 mm (approximately 1.4 √ó 1.8 inches)

United Kingdom: 35 √ó 45 mm, but with specific head size requirements

Canada: 50 √ó 70 mm (approximately 2 √ó 2.75 inches)

China: 33 √ó 48 mm (approximately 1.3 √ó 1.9 inches)

The U.S. 2√ó2 inch size is one of the most widely recognized standards. However, if you're applying for a passport, I'd recommend checking your specific country's requirements, as they often have additional specifications beyond just dimensions, such as:

Head size within the photo (usually 50-70% of the frame)
Background color (typically white or light gray)
Photo quality and recency requirements
Facial expression and positioning rules
Are you preparing passport photos for a specific country?

How many pixels is that for United States 2x2?

For a United States 2√ó2 inch passport photo, the pixel dimensions depend on the resolution (DPI - dots per inch):

Common resolutions:

600 DPI (recommended for printing): 1200 √ó 1200 pixels
300 DPI (minimum acceptable): 600 √ó 600 pixels
150 DPI (lower quality): 300 √ó 300 pixels
The U.S. State Department specifically requires:

Minimum resolution: 600 √ó 600 pixels
Maximum resolution: 1200 √ó 1200 pixels
File size: Between 240 KB and 12 MB (for online submissions)
For best results, I'd recommend taking or creating the photo at 600 DPI (1200 √ó 1200 pixels). This ensures high print quality while staying within the official requirements.

If you're taking a digital photo to print or submit online, aim for at least 600 √ó 600 pixels at minimum, but 1200 √ó 1200 pixels is ideal.

I'm trying to create a new email address for "Pier Productions", but "pierproductions@gmail.com" is already taken.  Can you suggest something similar for the name that is not old school?

Here are some modern email address suggestions for Pier Productions:

Clean & Professional:

hello@pierproductions.com (if you get a custom domain)
pier.productions@gmail.com
pierproductionsstudio@gmail.com
studiopier@gmail.com
thepierproductions@gmail.com
Modern & Branded:

getpier@gmail.com
pierpro@gmail.com
pierproductionsco@gmail.com
wearepier@gmail.com
madebypier@gmail.com
Creative Variations:

pierproductionshq@gmail.com
pierproductions.studio@gmail.com
pier.studio@gmail.com
atpier@gmail.com
piercreative@gmail.com
Tip: If you're serious about the brand, consider getting a custom domain (pierproductions.com) and using something like hello@pierproductions.com or contact@pierproductions.com. It looks much more professional than Gmail and gives you full control over your email addresses.

What type of production work does Pier Productions do? That might help me suggest something even more tailored!

I have a domain reserved called chetly.net on GoDaddy, but it's not the URL I want to use for this email address, I want it to be hosted by Gmail.  I haven't setup the website yet either, so it's not ready for use.  There are too many companies using "Pier Productions" in one way or another, so I'm not interested in pursuing a URL for it.  I have to pick the email address that's available.  It looks like pierproductionsstudio@gmail.com is available, so I'm going to continue with that.

Perfect! pierproductionsstudio@gmail.com is a solid choice - it's professional, clear, and modern enough. The "studio" addition gives it a creative/professional feel without being too trendy.

Good luck with Pier Productions! üé¨

Okay, that worked.  I now have pierproductionsstudios@gmail.com.  Now, can you walk me through setting it up so I login to jackleonardpier@gmail.com and can see all the incoming traffic and make outgoing emails "sent as" pierproductionsstudios@gmail.com?

Sure! Here's how to set up Gmail so you can manage pierproductionsstudios@gmail.com from your jackleonardpier@gmail.com account:

Step 1: Enable "Send mail as" in the Pier Productions account
Log into pierproductionsstudios@gmail.com
Click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) ‚Üí See all settings
Go to Accounts and Import tab
Scroll to Grant access to your account
Click Add another account
Enter jackleonardpier@gmail.com and follow the prompts
This will send a confirmation email to your Jack account
Step 2: Set up "Send mail as" in your Jack account
Log into jackleonardpier@gmail.com
Click the gear icon ‚Üí See all settings
Go to Accounts and Import tab
Scroll to Send mail as
Click Add another email address
Enter name: "Pier Productions" (or whatever you want)
Enter email: pierproductionsstudios@gmail.com
Uncheck "Treat as an alias" (important!)
Click Next Step ‚Üí Send verification
Check the Pier Productions inbox for the verification code and enter it
Step 3: Set up mail forwarding from Pier Productions to Jack
Log into pierproductionsstudios@gmail.com
Click gear icon ‚Üí See all settings
Go to Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab
Click Add a forwarding address
Enter jackleonardpier@gmail.com
Confirm the forwarding code sent to your Jack account
Select Forward a copy of incoming mail to jackleonardpier@gmail.com
Choose whether to keep copies in Pier Productions inbox or archive/delete them
Now all emails sent to pierproductionsstudios@gmail.com will appear in your jackleonardpier@gmail.com inbox, and you can send emails as Pier Productions directly from your Jack account!

After step 2, I got a message saying it could take some time...

Yes, that's normal! Gmail needs to send a verification email to pierproductionsstudios@gmail.com with a confirmation code or link.

What to do:

Wait a few minutes (usually arrives within 1-5 minutes)
Log into pierproductionsstudios@gmail.com
Look for an email from Gmail with subject like "Gmail Confirmation - Send Mail as pierproductionsstudios@gmail.com"
Either click the confirmation link in that email, OR copy the verification code
Go back to jackleonardpier@gmail.com and enter the code if needed
If it's taking longer than 10 minutes, check:

Spam/junk folder in pierproductionsstudios@gmail.com
Make sure you typed the email correctly when adding it
Once you confirm, you'll be able to send emails as Pier Productions! Then you can proceed with Step 3 to set up the forwarding so incoming mail to Pier Productions shows up in your Jack account.

Let me know when you get the verification email and we can continue!

Can you give me some options for setting up a small website for chetly.net?  It's hosted by GoDaddy, so I know they have some DIY options, but I'd like to consider AI tools that might build it for me.  What do you think?

Great question! Here are your best options for building a website for chetly.net:

AI Website Builders (Easiest & Fastest)
Framer AI - My top recommendation

Type what you want, AI generates a beautiful, modern site
Highly customizable, professional templates
Easy to connect custom domains
Free tier available, paid plans ~$5-15/month
Very trendy, modern designs
Wix ADI (Artificial Design Intelligence)

Answer questions, AI builds your site
Since you're on GoDaddy, you can point your domain to Wix
Drag-and-drop editing after AI creates it
Plans start ~$16/month
10Web AI Builder

AI generates WordPress sites in minutes
Good for more complex sites
WordPress flexibility with AI speed
~$10/month
Durable AI

Creates business sites in 30 seconds
Very simple, good for basic needs
~$12-15/month
GoDaddy Options
GoDaddy Website Builder

Built into your hosting, easiest domain setup
AI-assisted design (not fully AI)
Templates are decent but can look generic
Already included with many hosting plans
My Recommendation
If you want something modern and impressive: Use Framer AI or Wix ADI, then point chetly.net to it (GoDaddy makes this easy with DNS settings).

If you want simple and integrated: Stick with GoDaddy's builder since your domain is already there.

What's the website for? (Portfolio, business, blog, etc.) That would help me give you a more specific recommendation!

It's for my band "Chetly"... an alternative rock group from Southlake, TX.

Awesome! For a band website, you want something that looks cool, showcases your music/videos, and maybe handles show dates and merch. Here's what I'd recommend:

Best Options for a Band Site
Bandzoogle (Built specifically for musicians)

Templates designed for bands
Built-in music player, show calendar, mailing list
Sell merch and music directly (no commission!)
Easy to connect chetly.net
~$10-20/month
No AI builder, but super easy templates
Framer AI (Most modern/impressive)

AI builds a sleek, custom site in minutes
Great for visual impact and first impressions
Embed Spotify/Apple Music, YouTube, etc.
Show calendar via integrations
~$5-15/month
Best if you want to stand out visually
Wix with Music Features

AI builder gets you started
Good music/band templates
Event calendar, music players built-in
~$16/month
Squarespace (Beautiful templates)

Not AI, but stunning band templates
Great for photos/videos
Audio blocks for music
~$16-23/month
Professional look
My Recommendation for Chetly
Go with Framer AI if you want something modern and unique that'll impress people, or Bandzoogle if you want all the band-specific features (merch store, mailing list, gig calendar) ready to go without much setup.

Quick question: Do you already have music on Spotify/Apple Music, or are you looking to host audio files directly on the site?

First, I need something free, or a small one time purchase.  Second, We have two songs on Spotify/Apple Music already and songs we're working on are hosted on Soundcloud.

Ah, got it! Free or one-time purchase changes things. Here are your best options:

Free Options
GitHub Pages + Jekyll (Totally free)

Free hosting forever
Connect chetly.net for free
Use free band templates (Jekyll themes)
Embed Spotify/Soundcloud players easily
Requires some basic coding (but lots of tutorials)
Best for: Tech-comfortable bands
Wix Free Plan

Free forever (with Wix ads)
Drag-and-drop, no coding
Connect chetly.net (~$5/year extra)
Embed music players, show dates, etc.
Best for: Quick and easy
Google Sites (Totally free)

Super simple, clean templates
Free custom domain connection
Embed Spotify/Soundcloud easily
Very basic but functional
Best for: Minimalists
Carrd.co (Free for simple sites)

One-page sites (perfect for bands starting out)
Free plan available, Pro is $19/year (one-time annual)
Modern, clean designs
Easy embeds for music
Best for: Simple, stylish one-pagers
One-Time Purchase
Grapedrop ($49 one-time)

Visual website builder
No monthly fees after purchase
Modern templates
Connect custom domain
My Recommendation for Chetly
Carrd.co Pro ($19/year) - It's essentially a one-time yearly fee, modern looking, perfect for embedding Spotify/Soundcloud players, show dates, social links, and photos. Great for alternative rock bands that want something sleek without monthly costs.

Or GitHub Pages (free) if you're comfortable with a bit of tech setup - totally free forever and you can make it look however you want.

Want help choosing based on your tech comfort level?

I'm pretty good with syntax and know basic HTML, so tell me more about GitHub Pages... how would that work?  Do you build it on their site, like Wix?

Perfect! If you know basic HTML, GitHub Pages is actually ideal for you. Here's how it works:

How GitHub Pages Works
It's NOT like Wix - there's no drag-and-drop builder. Instead:

You create HTML/CSS files locally (on your computer)
Push them to a GitHub repository (free account)
GitHub hosts them for free at yourusername.github.io
Connect your custom domain (chetly.net) in settings
Two Approaches:
Option 1: Pure HTML/CSS (Simple)

Write your own HTML files
Add CSS for styling
Upload to GitHub
Total control, but you build everything
Option 2: Jekyll Static Site Generator (Smarter)

Uses templates/themes (still HTML/CSS based)
Write content in Markdown (simpler than HTML)
Jekyll generates the site automatically
Tons of free band/portfolio themes available
GitHub Pages has Jekyll built-in
Basic Workflow:
Create free GitHub account
Create a repository named yourusername.github.io
Add your HTML/CSS files (or pick a Jekyll theme)
Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings
Point chetly.net to GitHub (change DNS in GoDaddy)
Your site is live!
For Band Sites Specifically:
You'd want:

Home page with band photo/bio
Embedded Spotify/Soundcloud players (just copy embed codes)
Show dates (simple HTML list or table)
Contact/social links
Maybe a photos/videos page
I can actually help you create the HTML files if you want! Would you like me to build you a starter template for Chetly that you can customize and deploy to GitHub Pages?

I'd like to see the templates in the Jekyll themes... sounds easier

Great choice! Jekyll themes will save you tons of time. Here are the best places to find free Jekyll themes for a band site:

Where to Browse Jekyll Themes
Jekyll Themes Official

https://jekyllthemes.io/free
Filter by "portfolio" or "blog" (work well for bands)
Preview before downloading
GitHub Jekyll Theme Showcase

https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme
Thousands of free themes
See live demos and code
JekyllThemes.org

http://jekyllthemes.org/
Clean, curated list
Easy previews
Jekyll Themes on RubyGems

https://rubygems.org/search?query=jekyll-theme
Official theme repository
Good Starter Themes for Bands
Minimal Mistakes - Very popular, clean, customizable Forty - Bold, image-heavy (great for bands) Spectral - Modern, one-page design Cayman - Simple, photo-focused Type Theme - Clean blog-style (good for updates/news)

How It Works
Browse themes and pick one you like
Fork/download the theme from GitHub
Customize the _config.yml file (band name, social links, etc.)
Add your content (bio, embed codes for Spotify/Soundcloud)
Push to your GitHub repository
Done!
Want me to walk you through setting up a specific theme once you pick one? Or I could show you how to set up a basic Jekyll site from scratch and you can apply a theme later?

On second thought, I'd like you to help setup the GitHub Account and setup a basic page with just the band photo and buttons that can take you to different streaming platforms, an email link, etc...

Perfect! Let's build a clean, simple band page. I'll walk you through the GitHub setup and create the HTML for you.

Step 1: Create GitHub Account
Go to https://github.com
Click Sign up
Create username (suggestion: chetlyband or chetly-music)
Use your jackleonardpier@gmail.com or pierproductionsstudios@gmail.com
Verify email
Step 2: Create Repository
Once logged in, click the + icon (top right) ‚Üí New repository
Name it: yourusername.github.io (replace "yourusername" with your actual GitHub username)
Example: chetlyband.github.io
Make it Public
Check "Add a README file"
Click Create repository
Step 3: I'll Create the Website Files
Before we continue, I need a couple things:

What's your GitHub username? (so I can give you exact instructions)
Do you have the band photo ready? (I'll show you how to add it)
Which streaming platforms? (Spotify, Apple Music, Soundcloud... any others?)
Once you confirm those, I'll create a simple, modern HTML page with:

Band photo at the top
Clean buttons for each streaming platform
Email contact button
Social media links (if you want)
Mobile-friendly design
Ready to continue? Let me know your GitHub username when you've created it!

I have another email "chetlymusic@gmail.com" that I'm using. It's already setup.  What user name do you suggest?  the website suggested a suffix "-sudo" with Chetly or ChetlyMusic in front of it.

I'd go with something simpler and more straightforward than the "-sudo" suffix (that's just a GitHub suggestion based on availability).

Best options:

chetlyband - Clean, simple, professional

Your site would be: chetlyband.github.io
chetly-music - Clear what it is

Your site would be: chetly-music.github.io
chetlyofficial - Implies it's the official band page

Your site would be: chetlyofficial.github.io
thechetly - Another clean option

Your site would be: thechetly.github.io
My recommendation: Go with chetlyband - it's the cleanest and most professional. The "-sudo" suffix doesn't really mean anything for a band and might confuse people.

Since you'll eventually point chetly.net to this site anyway, the GitHub URL is just temporary. But chetlyband is short, memorable, and looks professional.

Which one do you like? Once you create the account with that username, I'll build you the HTML page!

how about just "chetly"?

Even better! chetly is perfect - shortest and cleanest option.

Try creating the account with username chetly. If it's available, that's definitely the way to go.

Your site would be: chetly.github.io

Once you get the account created, let me know and I'll build the HTML page for you!

Quick checklist while you're setting up:

Username: chetly
Email: chetlymusic@gmail.com
Then create the repository named: chetly.github.io
Let me know when you're ready for the next step!

I had to use "chetlymusic"

Perfect! chetlymusic works great.

So your site will be: chetlymusic.github.io

Next Steps:
1. Create the repository:

Click the + icon (top right) ‚Üí New repository
Name it exactly: chetlymusic.github.io
Make it Public
Check "Add a README file"
Click Create repository
2. Once that's done, I need to know:

Which streaming platforms do you want buttons for? (Spotify, Apple Music, Soundcloud... any others like YouTube, Bandcamp, Instagram, etc.?)
Do you want an email contact button? (I assume yes - should it go to chetlymusic@gmail.com?)
3. About the band photo:

Do you have it ready to upload? (We'll add it to GitHub)
What format is it? (JPG, PNG?)
Once you confirm these details, I'll create a clean, modern HTML page with all your links ready to go!

Have you created the chetlymusic.github.io repository yet?

there's a "Create repository" button in the upper left corner.  Should I use that?

Yes! Click that "Create repository" button.

Then:

Repository name: Enter chetlymusic.github.io (exactly like that)
Description (optional): "Official Chetly band website" or leave blank
Public (make sure this is selected)
Check the box for "Add a README file"
Click "Create repository" at the bottom
That will set up your site! Let me know when you've done that and we'll move to the next step.

What do I answer for Add .gitignore  and Add license?

You can leave both of those as "None" - they're optional and not needed for a simple band website.

Add .gitignore: None
Choose a license: None
Just make sure you have:

Repository name: chetlymusic.github.io
Public selected
"Add a README file" checked
Then click "Create repository" and you're good to go!

okay, it's done

Awesome! Now let's add your website files.

Quick Info I Need:
Streaming platforms - Which ones do you want buttons for?
Spotify ‚úì
Apple Music ‚úì
Soundcloud ‚úì
YouTube?
Bandcamp?
Instagram?
Any others?
Email button - Should it link to chetlymusic@gmail.com?
Band photo - Do you have it ready? We'll upload it in a moment.
Once you tell me which platforms you want, I'll create the HTML page for you and show you how to add it to your repository!

Let's just start with Spotify, Soundcloud and YouTube. 2. Yes, 3. Yes
Perfect! Let me create a clean, modern website for Chetly.

I'll build an HTML page with:

Band photo at the top
Buttons for Spotify, Soundcloud, and YouTube
Email contact button (chetlymusic@gmail.com)
Mobile-friendly design
Modern, rock band aesthetic
Give me a moment to create this for you...

Chetly Band Website
Interactive artifact 
Perfect! I've created your band website. Here's what to do next:

Step 1: Add the HTML file to GitHub
In your chetlymusic.github.io repository, click "Add file" ‚Üí "Create new file"
Name it: index.html
Copy ALL the code from the artifact above and paste it into the file editor
Scroll down and click "Commit new file"
Step 2: Upload your band photo
Click "Add file" ‚Üí "Upload files"
Upload your band photo
IMPORTANT: Rename it to band-photo.jpg (or if it's a PNG, name it band-photo.png and change line 71 in the HTML from band-photo.jpg to band-photo.png)
Click "Commit changes"
Step 3: Update the links
You need to replace the placeholder URLs with your actual links:

Click on index.html in your repository
Click the pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è) to edit
Find and replace:
Line 73: YOUR_ARTIST_ID with your actual Spotify artist ID
Line 81: YOUR_SOUNDCLOUD with your Soundcloud username
Line 89: YOUR_CHANNEL with your YouTube channel handle
Click "Commit changes"
Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
Go to Settings (in your repository)
Scroll to "Pages" (left sidebar)
Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
Under "Branch", select "main" and /root
Click "Save"
Your site will be live at chetlymusic.github.io in a few minutes!
